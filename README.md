Cancer-detection
================

It is a multiclass classification problem. Given a data of genes, variation, we
need to classify it into one of the 9 classes.

 

The genes, variations are converted into two types of features

1.  One hot encoded features

2.  Response coded features

 

Classification models used are

1.  Naive Bayes

2.  KNN

3.  Logistic Regression

4.  Random Forest

5.  Stacking classifier

 

Performance metric used is Multiclass Log-loss

Logistic regression performs best over all the other models. It gives 0.97
logloss.
